# Capstone_Project - Dog Breed Classifier

- We aim to build a Dog Breed Classifier app, that, provided an image, will respectively predict the breed of the dog, if a dog is detected in the image, or the most resembling dog breed if a human face is detected in the image, or output an error message if neither a dog nor a human face are detected in the image. 

- This multi-class classification problem will involve detecting dogs and human faces in images, training and deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with PyTorch to predict the breed of a dog detected in a picture and building a small app which allows a user to input an image and get a prediction of the dog breed our model thinks it sees.

- The datasets used in this project can be downloaded from the Udacity project-dog-classification GitHub:

- The code, results and final app examples are included in the dog_app.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
